# Usage

Open terminal application and goto you project directory (where the
gulpfile.babel.js is). Execute following command on the terminal in order to
start email utility.

npm run build

The utility will automatically open a browser window where all changes are
updated automatically.

NOTE!

Preview DOES NOT handle any interface tags, so the output might look incorrect
or awful. In order to preview the emails you need to uplado files from the "dist/"
directory to your theme's root folder.

You can ignore following files and directories while uploading your changes to
the MyCashflow's servers.

dist/css/
dist/index.html
